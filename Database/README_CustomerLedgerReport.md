# Customer Ledger Report Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Customer Ledger Report feature for the Distribution Software system. The report follows the same pattern as the existing Supplier Ledger Report.

## Files Created

### 1. Database Files
- **`sp_GetCustomerLedgerReport.sql`** - Stored procedure for retrieving customer ledger data
- **`TestCustomerLedgerReport.sql`** - Test script to validate the stored procedure
- **`README_CustomerLedgerReport.md`** - This documentation file

### 2. Model Files
- **`CustomerLedgerReportData.cs`** - Data model for customer ledger report

### 3. UI Files
- **`CustomerLedgerReportForm.cs`** - Main form class with business logic
- **`CustomerLedgerReportForm.Designer.cs`** - Form designer file with UI controls

### 4. Report Files
- **`CustomerLedgerReport.rdlc`** - RDLC report definition file

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Install the Stored Procedure
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. Connect to your DistributionDB database
3. Open and execute the `sp_GetCustomerLedgerReport.sql` file
4. Verify the stored procedure was created successfully

### Step 2: Test the Stored Procedure
1. Execute the `TestCustomerLedgerReport.sql` file
2. Check the results to ensure the procedure works correctly
3. If no data is returned, ensure you have:
   - Active customers in the Customers table
   - Transaction data in the CustomerTransactions table

### Step 3: Add the Report to Your Application
1. Copy the model file to your Models folder
2. Copy the form files to your Presentation/Forms folder
3. Copy the RDLC file to your Reports folder
4. Rebuild your solution

## Report Features

### Filters
- **Customer**: Select specific customer or "All Customers"
- **Date Range**: Start date and end date selection

### Report Data
The report displays:
- Transaction Date
- Transaction Type (Sales Invoice, Payment Received, Sales Return)
- Description
- Reference Number
- Payment Amount (amount received from customer)
- Sales Amount (amount customer owes us)
- Running Balance (cumulative balance)

### Summary Information
- Total Payments for the period
- Total Sales for the period
- Total Returns for the period
- Opening Balance
- Closing Balance

## Database Schema Requirements

The report requires the following tables:
- **Customers** - Customer master data
- **CustomerTransactions** - Transaction ledger entries

### Expected Table Structure

#### Customers Table
```sql
- CustomerId (INT, Primary Key)
- CustomerCode (VARCHAR)
- CustomerName (VARCHAR)
- ContactName (VARCHAR)
- Phone (VARCHAR)
- Email (VARCHAR)
- Address (VARCHAR)
- City (VARCHAR)
- State (VARCHAR)
- Country (VARCHAR)
- GSTNumber (VARCHAR)
- CreditLimit (DECIMAL)
- OutstandingBalance (DECIMAL)
- PaymentTerms (VARCHAR)
- IsActive (BIT)
```

#### CustomerTransactions Table
```sql
- TransactionId (BIGINT, Primary Key)
- CustomerId (INT, Foreign Key)
- TransactionDate (DATETIME)
- TransactionType (VARCHAR) -- 'Sales', 'Payment', 'Return'
- Description (VARCHAR)
- ReferenceNumber (VARCHAR)
- DebitAmount (DECIMAL)
- CreditAmount (DECIMAL)
- Balance (DECIMAL)
- IsActive (BIT)
```

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Report
1. Open the Customer Ledger Report form
2. Select a customer from the dropdown (or leave as "All Customers")
3. Set the date range
4. Click "Generate Report"
5. The report will display in the ReportViewer control
6. Use "Export PDF" to save the report

### Report Parameters
- **StartDate**: Beginning of the reporting period
- **EndDate**: End of the reporting period
- **CustomerFilter**: Selected customer name or "All Customers"

## Technical Details

### Stored Procedure Logic
1. Calculates opening balance from transactions before the start date
2. Retrieves all transactions within the date range
3. Calculates running balance for each transaction
4. Returns transaction details with customer information
5. Provides summary totals

### Error Handling
- Database connection validation
- Data availability checks
- Graceful handling of empty results
- Comprehensive error messages

### Performance Considerations
- Uses indexed columns for filtering
- Efficient JOIN operations
- Proper parameter binding to prevent SQL injection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No customers found"**
   - Ensure Customers table has active records
   - Check IsActive = 1 condition

2. **"No transactions found"**
   - Verify CustomerTransactions table has data
   - Check date range selection
   - Ensure transactions are marked as IsActive = 1

3. **"Report file not found"**
   - Verify CustomerLedgerReport.rdlc is in the Reports folder
   - Check file path in the application

4. **Database connection errors**
   - Verify connection string in App.config
   - Ensure SQL Server is running
   - Check database permissions

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Stored procedure executes without errors
- [ ] Test script runs successfully
- [ ] Form loads without errors
- [ ] Report generates with sample data
- [ ] Export functionality works
- [ ] All filters work correctly

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Add more transaction types
2. Include credit limit analysis
3. Add aging analysis
4. Export to Excel format
5. Add chart visualizations
6. Implement drill-down capabilities

## Support

For technical support or questions about this implementation:
1. Check the error logs in the application
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Test with the provided test script
4. Review the stored procedure logic
5. Check the RDLC report definition
