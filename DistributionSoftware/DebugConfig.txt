Visual Studio Debugging Configuration for Distribution Software
=============================================================

To debug the Sales Invoice creation process:

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Set breakpoints at these key locations:
   - SalesInvoiceService.cs line 87: Before database call
   - SalesInvoiceRepository.cs line 135: Before ExecuteScalar
   - SalesInvoiceService.cs line 111: Exception handling

3. Run in Debug mode (F5)
4. When creating a sales invoice, the debugger will break at these points
5. Use the Debug Output window to see debug messages
6. Use the Locals window to inspect variable values

Key Variables to Watch:
- invoice.CustomerId
- invoice.BarcodeImage
- invoice.Items (count and values)
- command.Parameters (in repository)

Debug Output Window:
- All debug messages will appear in the Debug Output window
- Look for "=== CREATE SALES INVOICE DEBUG START ==="
- Follow the step-by-step process
- Check for any error messages

Exception Handling:
- If an exception occurs, the debugger will break at line 111
- Inspect the exception details in the Locals window
- Check the Stack Trace for the exact error location
